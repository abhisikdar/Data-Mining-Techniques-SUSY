# About:
Exploratory data analysis and various supervised learning algorithms applied over the SUSY dataset, taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The SUSY dataset contains 5 million data points, each with 18 features- 8 low level particle kinetics features and 10 higher level features which are functions of the first 8.
We perform Exploratory Data Analysis followed by Supervised Classification algorithms like Decision Trees(with pruning), Random Forests, Naive Bayes, KNN, ANN and Bagging with Trees. We also perform parameter tuning.
